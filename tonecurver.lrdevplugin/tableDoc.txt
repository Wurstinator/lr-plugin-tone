tone is a Lua table.
Let (x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn) be the data points of the tone curve, with x1 < x2 < ... < xn, and values from 0 to 100%.
Then tone is of size 2*n, with keys being consecutive integers from 1 to 2*n. tone[2*i - 1] corresponds to xi; tone[2*i] corresponds to yi.
The values of tone are bytes from 0 to 255; with 0 corresponding to 0%, 128 corresponding to 50%, 255 corresponding to 100%, and linear mapping between.
